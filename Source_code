        <h2>Early Life and Influences</h2>
        <p>
            My mother, Fatuma Mwenda Ngumbau, was born on 17/06/1986 in Mombasa. 
            From a young age, she showed unconditional love to her siblings. 
            She grew up in a small village, the eldest of six siblings. From a young age, she took on the role of caretaker, helping her mother with chores and looking after her younger brothers and sisters. Despite the hardships of poverty, she excelled in school, often studying by candlelight after long days of work.
            As a teenager, she sacrificed her own dreams of higher education to support her family, working tirelessly to ensure her siblings had opportunities she never had. Her kindness and resilience shaped her into the nurturing mother she would later becomeâ€”one who always put others before herself, ensuring her children felt loved, safe, and encouraged to chase their dreams.
